# Undergraduate-University-Project
My undergraduate project for the University of Hull from 2017.

This project was to show my web server scripting skills in PHP. The project was meant to be a homage to YouTube and had most of the functionality that it had at that time. CSS was not the main priority with this project.

The database that ran the back-end of the project no longer exists. I may recreate the database in the fututre and update its styling for preservation purposes.

I have also uploaded the design/testing documentation that went with this project.
